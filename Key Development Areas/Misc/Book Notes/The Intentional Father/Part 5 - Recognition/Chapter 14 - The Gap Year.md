# Chapter 14 - The Gap Year

### Principle

*Young men need a liminal space where they are removed from the normal rhythm and routine of life and five time and opportunity to see what is inside them. They need space to encounter those who have frown up in completely different cultural contexts and bond with other men. In modern life, nothing does this quite as we as a gap year.*

### Notes

#### Goals of Gap Year
* Realize life is not just about himself
* Avoid preying to an overwhelming feeling that he has to get ahead and do things NOW
#### Father-Son Pilgrimage
* Take your son on a pilgrimage journey with you
