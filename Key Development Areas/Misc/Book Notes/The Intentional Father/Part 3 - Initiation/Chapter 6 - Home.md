# Chapter 6 - Home

### Principle

*Until we know the story we are in, we will never know the character we are called to become. It is important that young men get a sense of a larger story and tradition, so they have some context for living well and break the delusion that the world revolves around them.*

| A trip back home | Context provides meaning and helps us know that to do with our lives. Let your son know your story - your family background, the place you grew up, and the moments that shaped you into the man and father you are today. Take a journey HOME with your son! Show him the places, experiences and people that shape you into who you are. |

### Questions to Think About

- What are the key places and moments from my teenage years I would want to share with my son so he understands me better.
- Who are the key people who’ve helped me become who I am?
- What are the specific themes or words I’d like to impart on this trip?

### Intentional Steps

Create a genogram to help your son know your family legacy and history. Maybe there are things to be proud of; maybe there are cautionary tales. 

Plan a Story Context Trip

| *What special things can you do?* | Make the trip memorable for your son, create bonding moments that will last a lifetime. Think about the fun activities that you can do together. |
| Values | What values do you want to impart on your son? How can you do that? |

You want this trip to put your son’s story in context and help him understand more about you. What will make this a win for you? What will make this enjoyable for your son?
