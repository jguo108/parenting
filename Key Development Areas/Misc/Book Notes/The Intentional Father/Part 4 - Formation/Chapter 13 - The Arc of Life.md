# Chapter 13 - The Arc of Life

### Principle

*Young men rarely think long and hard about the decisions and directions they want their lives to take. The horizon of their thinking often extends to the end of their current season and the start of the next. But wise men understand the arc and seasons of a life and seek to live well in each season to minimize regret and maximize joy.* 

### Notes

| Key Points | Details |
| --- | --- |
| The arc of life | Expose your son to all the seasons and stages of life, along with their corresponding temptations and joys. 

* High schools. It’s about Exposing us to life. Explore, experience, don’t close off your options, don’t say no, don’t say you don’t like something.
* College. It’s about Learning. Learning what you like, learning more about God and learning more about yourself.
* Twenties. It’s about Growing. Figuring out who you are as a person and getting better at that. 
* Thirties. It’s about Editing. Since you know what your cause is, you shut off certain options and only focus on things that matter.
* Forties. It’s about Mastering. You emerge as a master of your craft.
* Fifties. It’s about Harvesting. 
* Sixties. It’s about Guiding. Taking your attention away from yourself and taking notice of the generations coming after you.
* Seventies. It’s about Imparting. Taking what you have learnt your whole life and teaching that to others, leaving a legacy and history for others.
* Eighties. It’s about Savoring. 
* Nineties. It’s about Preparing to reach the finishing line. |
| Meet the people | Help your son to meet different wise people at different stages of life, come up with questions to ask those people and learn from them.  |

### Questions to Think About

- What stage of life are you currently in?
- How have people in other stages of life spoken into your existence and helped you navigate or prepare for an upcoming stage?

### Intentional Steps

Find at least one people at each stage of life who will generate the kind of discussion that explores the joys and temptations of that stage of life.

| People | Stage | Questions |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | High School | * What did you most enjoy about you current life stage? Why?
* What are the three of your favorite memories of this stage?
* What are your biggest regrets of this stage?
* If you had this stage to do again, what would you do differently?
* What things must I absolutely get right in that stage?
* What things must I absolutely avoid in that stage?
* If you could speak into my life, knowing what you know about me, what would you say? |
