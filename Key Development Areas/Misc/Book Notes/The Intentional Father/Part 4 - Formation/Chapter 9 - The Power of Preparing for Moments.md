# Chapter 9 - The Power of Preparing for Moments

### Principle

*So much our lives is defined by moments. Moments of wonder, moments of heartache, moments of accomplishment, moments of regret. An intentional father is aware of the power of moments and works hard in advance to create live changing ones.*

### Questions to Think About
