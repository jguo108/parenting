# Chapter 10 - Being Good at Being a Man

### Principle

*Young men today don’t aspire to a moralistic vision of generic goodness. They want a deep understanding of what a man actually is and how to be good at that. They want the vision and skill to master the art of manhood. In this framework, confidence comes through competence. We must learn to transfer the tangible skills and they key elements of manhood to our sons.*
