### Key Points

- The current education system is failing because they want to make kids useful for the country, but not useful for the kids themselves.
- The current education system uses tests and scores to evaluate children’s performance. But this makes children less likely to take risks and have the courage to face multiple failures. However, in the real world, it is failure that makes us learn, adapt and eventually succeed.
- To make children better at facing failure or taking risks, we need to set goals that are achievable with step by step effort.
- The reason we are human is because we are agents that navigate an ever-changing world landscape. We decide what to learn and what path to take depending on the current situation. We do this by taking actions, observe results (make be failures), get feedbacks and adjust.
- AI is a specific tool in a specific context. It can do very well, in fact much better than human, with that tool in that context. But human should have multiple tools and know what tool or tools to use in any context. That’s the fundamental difference between AI and human. But our education system is making each of us more like AI, meaning we are just one specific tool in a specific context. To face the challenge of AI, we need to be real human with multiple tools at our hands.
