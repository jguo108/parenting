## How Our Fear Of Failure Undermines Education

### Notes

* Despite tensions between parents and teachers, decades of research shows that positive family-school relationships are vital to student success.

#### Guidelines for Creating Positive Partnerships with Teachers and Administrators

* *Show up at school with an attitude of optimism and trust*. If you are trusting and relaxed, he will be trusting and relaxed. If you are nervous and watching for the teacher to screw up, he will be nervous and watch for his teacher to screw up.
* *Be on time*. If tardy becomes a habit, do not blame it on the child. You are the parent; make being on time a priority. Back your morning schedule up by a half an hour if you have to.
* *Read the school's attendance policy and follow it*.
* *Be friendly and polite*.
* *Project an attitude of respect for education.*
* *Model enthusiasm for learning.*
* *Your attitudes toward education will be your child’s attitude*. Likewise, your enthusiasm for the process of learning for learning’s sake is vital to instilling the same in your child. Let your child see you reading for fun. Pick up a book about a topic you know nothing about and become the resident expert on something. Learn to play an instrument. Go to the library and browse books in subjects you’ve never read or check out college courses from The Great Courses and take a class you never got to take in high school or college. Find out what your child is reading at school and get an audio version of that book for the car. Talk about the book, about the big ideas, and what the characters are up to. You will get the opportunity to understand what your child is reading and learning, which will open the door to conversations about what it would take to make Boo Radley come out, or why Holden Caulfield wears that ridiculous hunting hat.
* *Make sure your first communication with a teacher is positive*. Make contact in the first month or so of school and find something nice to say. Mention an interesting dinnertime conversation you had with your child about a book he’s reading in class.
* *Invite teacher feedback.* 
* *Wait a day before emailing a teacher over a perceived emergency or crisis.* 
* *Let teachers know about big events unfolding at home.*
* *Express interests in what is being taught*. Let the teacher know you are interested in what’s going on at school, and find ways to explore that learning at home. Find opportunities to ask your child to teach you about something she learned in school.
* *Find opportunities to express gratitude.* The value of a thank-you cannot be overstated, and the practice of expressing gratitude is a great lesson to model for your kids. Have your child deliver that note to the teacher’s mailbox or office, and make him a part of the gesture.
* *Begin with the assumption that you have an interest in common - the student.*
* *Protect your child's right to fail.* Project confidence in her and in your ability to refrain from rescuing her from the challenge of these transitions and milestones. Keep your eyes on the prize of autonomy and competence, and remember that failure is going to be a vital part of her education, as vital as math or English or science. Give her the time and space she needs to be disappointed in herself. Finally, encourage her perseverance as she picks herself up, dusts herself off, and learns from experience that she is capable of rebounding from those failures.
* *Give your child a voice.* From the very first day of kindergarten, it is vital that children learn to advocate for themselves. When your child is dissatisfied with something that has happened at school, whether she is upset about a grade or feels a teacher has acted unfairly, the student should always be encouraged to speak to the teacher directly. I tell my students that the skill I respect most is the ability to calm down, think logically about the situation, and then engage in a balanced and rational conversation about conflict.
* *Remember that truth often lies between two perceptions.* When a teacher reports that something is going on with your child, at least consider that the teacher might be right.
* *If you are concern with a teacher's action, talk to that teacher*. 
* *The best time to conduct a parent-teacher meeting is at a scheduled meeting*. 
* *Read the school's handbook and disciplinary policy*. If you are incensed and upset by a teacher’s actions or discipline, talk to the teacher about your concerns and refrain from trashing the teacher in front of your child. The school’s rules may not be your rules, and you might not impose the same disciplinary action, but your child needs to understand that in the real world, people must abide by rules they don’t always agree with. Your child needs to own up to the consequences of breaking school rules, rebound from that, and move on with her education. Don’t save your kids. Let them learn as early as kindergarten how to walk up to someone who has misunderstood or mistreated them, stand up for themselves, and be heard.
* *Support the student-teacher partnership, even when it's challenging*. These teachers will be the people who will teach your child how to deal with the many challenging, unpleasant, contrary, and demanding people he will encounter over the course of his life. He will have problematic bosses, employees, boyfriends, girlfriends, spouses, and neighbors, and your child will have to learn how to get along with all of them.
