### Notes

* Homework is your _child’s_ job, not yours. _Your_ job is to support, encourage, and redirect your children when they are young, and as they get older, to make your expectations clear and get the heck out of their way.
* These stressful moments, when your child’s *frustration* levels are high, harbor the most valuable opportunities to foster *diligence*, *perseverance*, and *grit* in your child.
* Every time you take over, and rescue your child from working out a challenging math problem or thesis statement on her own, you undermine your child’s sense of confidence, and autonomy.
* Your job is not to save her from disappointment or embarrassment, but to sympathize, support, and help her find the strength and skills she will need for tomorrow night’s assignment.
* Once you’ve turned an objective eye to your child’s vision, hearing, sleep, and level of challenge, look at _how_ your child is doing that homework.
* The *Timer Cure* works like this: Determine which subject is taking up most of the student’s homework time, and then figure out how much time it’s taking each day.

#### Practical Steps to Help Children with Their Homework. 

* *Fuel up*. Healthy snacks  and drink of water.
* *Get rid of distractions*. Find a quiet, distraction-free space for homework time.
* *Understand expectations*. Know what teachers expect from your child.
* *Organize and strategize*. 
* *Suggest your child do the hardest work first*. Research shows that self-control is a limited commodity in the human brain, and reserves are likely to be at their highest levels at the start of homework time.
* *Evaluate the end product*. Teach kids to pause at the end of an assignment, and at the end of the homework period, and evaluate if the assignment has been completed according to instructions.
* *Complete what can be completed*.  If, after repeated attempts, your child cannot complete all of the work, encourage her to break the assignment down and do what she can. Here is where it’s important to speak with elementary school teachers about expectations. Some teachers would like parents to talk the child through the work, and others prefer that the sections that the child could not complete be left blank so that the teacher can see what the child does or does not know.
* *Aim for learning, not for perfection*. Homework is not only about finding the right answers; it’s about giving kids an opportunity to practice and expand skills they learned today and to prepare for the skills they will learn tomorrow.

#### Support, Encourage and Redirect

* When children are young, your job during homework time is to be nearby, busy with other activities, while the child is doing homework.
* Until he was nine or ten, I checked in on his progress every ten minutes or so, just to make sure he was on track, but now that he’s able to identify when he’s really stuck, as opposed to momentarily hung up on a concept or instruction, he asks me for help as needed.
* It’s really important that kids know we have other things to do in our lives than sit next to them and wait for them to get stuck and ask questions.
* Ask your child where and when she would like to complete her homework.
* The ability to initiate, delay gratification, see a task through to completion, and persist through frustration and challenge are incredibly important executive function skills, and homework encourages their development.
* Homework gives teachers feedback on how students are doing in terms of their progress toward mastery. When parents step in and “help,” however, teachers get an inaccurate representation of that mastery.
* Children’s struggles become more manageable when we support their efforts to work through it. As you recognize and empathize, remain autonomy-supportive and support by redirecting your child’s focus and effort. If he is really stuck, give him a new way to think about the problem, but do not step in to solve the problem for him.
* We need to learn how to hear pleas for homework help that indicate insurmountable difficulties as opposed to transitory, desirable challenges.
* When the homework session is at an end, remember the lessons of Carol Dweck and the growth mindset. Praise your child for the *effort* he put into his assignments, particularly when he encountered those frustrating difficulties that pushed him to the limits of what he thought he could do. Make sure he knows that you value his *persistence* as much as, if not more than, you value the answers he wrote after each problem. Whenever possible, reiterate the concept that the harder we work, and the more we stretch our brains, the smarter we become.

#### Clean Expectations and Room to Learn

*  This final aspect of learning, in which students create answers rather than merely recalling them, is called _generative learning_. Homework that promotes generative learning offers students opportunities to play with skills, exercise some trial and error, and create their own answers.
* Once high school begins, homework should be completely under students’ control, and unless they want to talk through an assignment or get your feedback on an idea, parents should not be involved in homework at all.
