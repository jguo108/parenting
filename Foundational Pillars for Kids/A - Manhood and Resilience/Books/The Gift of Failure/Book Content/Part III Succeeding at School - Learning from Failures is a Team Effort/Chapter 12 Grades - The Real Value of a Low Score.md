### Notes

* These failing moments are, more often than not, metaphorical roads diverging in a yellow wood, chances for children to decide what’s important to them, and whether or not they want to invest in their own learning.
* Grades are extrinsic rewards for academic performance. Extrinsic rewards undermine motivation and long-term learning. Ergo, grades undermine motivation and long-term learning.

#### Keep Grades in Their Proper Perspective

* Grades are not a measure of our children’s worth, and often they are not even an accurate measure of their ability.
* Grades are a measure of the skills that make for successful students: solid executive function skills, compliance, willingness to please, ability to follow directions, and self-discipline.
* Grades are less important than learning. Learning is the key to understanding our world, and the universe beyond; to communicating with other people, and to innovating for the future of our society. Grades are the key to certain academic institutions and a few office doors.
* Give your kids some space and don’t always talk about school and grades and stuff. Be there, and talk to them, like at dinner and in the car, but talk about the things they want to talk about.

#### Emphasize Goals Rather Than Grades

* Goals are self-determined rather than teacher-determined, they can be a much more useful measurement of success. When kids establish their own goals for learning, they gain a sense of ownership and competence.

#### Seek Feedbacks Rather Than Scores

* Many schools are moving to an assessment method called “*standards-based grading*” and abandoning *point-based grading* altogether. Standards-based grading assesses students on the skills or competencies a school has decided that student should learn in a given year.
* If your child’s school uses solely grades as a summative measure of learning, ask for more information at parent-teacher conferences and report that information back to your child.

#### Let Kids Steer Their Own Course

* As soon as your child has a choice about what classes to take, usually in middle school or early on in high school, course selection should be his job, not yours.
* *Choice* is one of the most important aspects of establishing *autonomy*, and if kids have a say in which classes they take, at what time, and with which teachers, they will have so much more ownership over their education.

#### Find Alternative Decorations for the Refrigerator

* It might be tempting to post that straight-A report card on the refrigerator, but doing so conveys the message that you love your children for their grades, not for themselves.
* A better way to approach grades and report cards is to talk to kids about what went well with a particular assignment or class when they receive a high grade. Ask what approaches worked for your child as he prepared for that French test, and what approaches did not work as well. If he gets a low grade on a test, ask what he might do differently next time, strategies that were successful or problematic. Grades should be a measure of progress, not a destination, so give them the weight and attention they deserve, no more.

#### Beware Grading Software Portals

* Checking in on children’s grades is a type of surveillance, which is one of the forms of control that is often mentioned in the research as an enemy of autonomy and intrinsic motivation.
* Checking in on your child’s grades, particularly without making an agreement in advance, communicates a lack of trust that makes me, for one, very uncomfortable.
#### Reinforce Failure as Opportunity

* Learning for learning’s sake, and the opportunity to establish intrinsic motivation early in a child’s education, far, far outweigh the impact of a few low grades, and in fact those low grades are necessary and beneficial lessons.
* People who don’t identify themselves as failures just because they have failed, who face their failures head-on and look for lessons in the mistakes, are the ones who emerge triumphant.
* Those who equate failures with being a failure, who go into denial, or seek to blame others for their failures are doomed to repeat their mistakes over and over again, gaining nothing from the experience.
* If you have a sense of contingent self-worth, if your attitude toward yourself depends on whether you “succeed” or “fail,” in a certain domain in comparison with other people, you may stop trying. Subconsciously you decide that the best way to avoid losing is to stay out of the game.
* Your attitude about autonomy and grades will inform your child’s attitude.
* I’d much rather be the person my kid wants to talk to over dinner about that funny thing that happened to his friend after math class, the movie he wants to see next weekend, his hopes and dreams. We have such a limited amount of time with our children as it is, so we might as well enjoy it while it lasts.
* Students recover. People do it all the time. And the failure helps them learn about themselves. First, they learn that people want them to be okay. Second, they learn that they can overcome a problem, but that work and attention are more important than genius or perfection. Students need to fail, because this is when they learn to succeed.
