### Notes

* These failing moments are, more often than not, metaphorical roads diverging in a yellow wood, chances for children to decide what’s important to them, and whether or not they want to invest in their own learning.
* Grades are extrinsic rewards for academic performance. Extrinsic rewards undermine motivation and long-term learning. Ergo, grades undermine motivation and long-term learning.

#### Keep Grades in Their Proper Perspective

* Grades are not a measure of our children’s worth, and often they are not even an accurate measure of their ability.
* Grades are a measure of the skills that make for successful students: solid executive function skills, compliance, willingness to please, ability to follow directions, and self-discipline.
* Grades are less important than learning. Learning is the key to understanding our world, and the universe beyond; to communicating with other people, and to innovating for the future of our society. Grades are the key to certain academic institutions and a few office doors.
* Give your kids some space and don’t always talk about school and grades and stuff. Be there, and talk to them, like at dinner and in the car, but talk about the things they want to talk about.

#### Emphasize Goals Rather Than Grades

* Goals are self-determined rather than teacher-determined, they can be a much more useful measurement of success. When kids establish their own goals for learning, they gain a sense of ownership and competence.

#### Seek Feedbacks Rather Than Scores

* Many schools are moving to an assessment method called “*standards-based grading*” and abandoning *point-based grading* altogether. Standards-based grading assesses students on the skills or competencies a school has decided that student should learn in a given year.
* If your child’s school uses solely grades as a summative measure of learning, ask for more information at parent-teacher conferences and report that information back to your child.

#### Let Kids Steer Their Own Course

* As soon as your child has a choice about what classes to take, usually in middle school or early on in high school, course selection should be his job, not yours.
* *Choice* is one of the most important aspects of establishing *autonomy*, and if kids have a say in which classes they take, at what time, and with which teachers, they will have so much more ownership over their education.

#### Find Alternative Decorations for the Refrigerator

* It might be tempting to post that straight-A report card on the refrigerator, but doing so conveys the message that you love your children for their grades, not for themselves.
* A better way to approach grades and report cards is to talk to kids about what went well with a particular assignment or class when they receive a high grade. Ask what approaches worked for your child as he prepared for that French test, and what approaches did not work as well. If he gets a low grade on a test, ask what he might do differently next time, strategies that were successful or problematic. Grades should be a measure of progress, not a destination, so give them the weight and attention they deserve, no more.
