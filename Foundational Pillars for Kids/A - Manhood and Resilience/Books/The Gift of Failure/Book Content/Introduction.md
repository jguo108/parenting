### Note

*  Because we lack supervision in our childhood, we ourselves become ever-present, ever-helpful, ever-reminding and ever rescuing parents. 

* Strategies that work in business does not work for parenting. Those strategies are for motivating assembly line workers, they are terrible tools for motivating children to engage in creative problem solving and undermine long-term motivation and learning. The use of rewards and incentives priorities scores and grades over exploration and experimentation, which undermines our ability to foster self-directed and intrinsically motivated learning.

* Parents are judged by their children's accomplishments rather than their happiness, so when our children fail, we appropriate those failures as our own.

* We need to distinguish between genuine, mortal threads to life and limb and the manageable thread of a soccer opponents flying downfield to steal the ball away from out child.

* The ability to attend to a task and stick to long-term goals is the greatest predictor of success, greater than academic achievement, extracurricular involvement, test score and IQ.

* If parents back off the pressure and anxiety over grades and achievement and focus on the bigger picture - a love of learning and independent inquiry - grades will improve and test scores will go up.

* Parents should focus on three goals: embracing opportunities to fail, finding ways to learn from that failure and creating positive home-school relationship.

* Don't make your child ever think they are incapable of doing something. Be patient and work through the problem with them together.
