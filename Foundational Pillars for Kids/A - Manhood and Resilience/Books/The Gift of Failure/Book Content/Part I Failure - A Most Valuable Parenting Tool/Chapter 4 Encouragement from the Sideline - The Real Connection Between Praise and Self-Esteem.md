### Note

* When you praise kids for their intelligence, you are "labeling" them. Once they think their accomplishment is due to their intelligence, they are less likely to try more challenging problems because they might fail at that and that fail to keep that image and label intact.
* By telling kids that they are good at something when they are patently not, we ruin that credibility and do little for their self-esteem as the truth at some point will be revealed. 
* Kids who are praised for their efforts do not give up on hard problems easily because they do not take failure personally. They do not think that their inability to correctly answer the problems right away mean that they are not smart. Instead, they think the hard problems are more fun.
* Kids should have a <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">belief</span> in their ability to succeed. <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Not confidence</span> in their ability to succeed, not magical thinking based on parents' effusive praise, but a <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">belief</span> based on experience and repeated effort in a skill or task. 

#### Ideas for Praising Kids

* Praise for <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">effort</span>, not <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">inherent qualities</span>. 
* Adopt a <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">growth mindset</span> in your own life, even when it makes you uncomfortable. 
* Don't reinforce <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">maladaptive reactions</span> to failure. 
* Make sure your child knows his failures do not <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">lessen your love or <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">opinon</span> on him</span>.
* Let your child feel <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">disappointed</span> by failure.
* Do not offer to <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">rescue</span> your child from the <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">consequences</span> of his mistakes.
