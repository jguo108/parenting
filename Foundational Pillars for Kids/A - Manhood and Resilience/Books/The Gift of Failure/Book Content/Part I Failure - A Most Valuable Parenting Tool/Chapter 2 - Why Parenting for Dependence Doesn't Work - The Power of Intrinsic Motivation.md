### Note

* Fear of failure destroys love of learning.
* Children leans in difficult situations. They learn to be creative in problem-solving, they learn diligence, they learn self-control and perseverance. But because our children are so afraid of failure, they start to take on fewer challenges. They know if they try something challenging or new, and fail, that failure will be hard evidence that they are not as smart as everyone keeps tell them. Better to be safe. That's why we should praise for effect, not for intellect. 

#### Intrinsic Motivation: The Holy Grail of Parenting

* The less we push our kids toward educational success, the more they will learn. The less we use external, or extrinsic, rewards on our children, the more they will engage in their education for the sake and love of learning. 
* Rewards may get results in the short term, but when it comes to encouraging long-term drive and enthusiasm for learning, rewards are terrible motivators. Human perceive rewards as attempts to control behaviour, this undermines intrinsic motivation. Human are more likely to stick with tasks that arise out of their own free will and personal choice. 
* When a kid is fascinated by a task, he is more likely to persevere, even when he falters, even when the task gets more challenging, even when the fails to master the task the first time around. We should preserve this natural curiosity and thirst for discovery at all costs. 
* Anything human perceive as controlling is detrimental to long-term motivation and therefore, learning. The quickest way to kill a child's interest in a game, topic or experiment is to impose your own will on his/her learning
* The best way is to back off, allow kids to have control and autonomy they crave even if it means struggling with the task or situation at hand. Set the goal firmly, but let children decide how to get there.

#### Autonomy, in Which Kids Find Out That Self-Reliance Feels Great

* Rewards work for repetitive, uncomplicated or boring tasks, but when it comes to creativity and nuanced learning, they are lousy motivators. Rewards inhibits creativity and risk-taking. 
* Control is the enemy of autonomy.
