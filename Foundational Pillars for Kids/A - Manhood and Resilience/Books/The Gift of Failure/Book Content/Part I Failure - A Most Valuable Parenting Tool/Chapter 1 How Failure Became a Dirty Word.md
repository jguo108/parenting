### Note

* Parenting for autonomy. Parenting for independence and a sense of self, born out of real competence, not misguided confidence. Parenting for resilience in the face of mistakes and failures. Parenting for what is right and good in the fail tally, not for what feels right and good in the moment. Parenting for tomorrow, not just for today.
