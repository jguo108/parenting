### Note

* Fear of failure destroys love of learning.
* Children leans in difficult situations. They learn to be creative in problem-solving, they learn diligence, they learn self-control and perseverance. But because our children are so afraid of failure, they start to take on fewer challenges. They know if they try something challenging or new, and fail, that failure will be hard evidence that they are not as smart as everyone keeps tell them. Better to be safe. That's why we should praise for effect, not for intellect. 

#### Intrinsic Motivation: The Holy Grail of Parenting

* The less we push our kids toward educational success, the more they will learn. The less we use external, or extrinsic, rewards on our children, the more they will engage in their education for the sake and love of learning. 
* Rewards may get results in the short term, but when it comes to encouraging long-term drive and enthusiasm for learning, rewards are terrible motivators. Human perceive rewards as attempts to control behavior, this undermines intrinsic motivation. Human are more likely to stick with tasks that arise out of their own free will and personal choice. 
* When a kid is fascinated by a task, he is more likely to persevere, even when he falters, even when the task gets more challenging, even when the fails to master the task the first time around. We should preserve this natural curiosity and thirst for discovery at all costs. 
* Anything human perceive as controlling is detrimental to long-term motivation and therefore, learning. The quickest way to kill a child's interest in a game, topic or experiment is to impose your own will on his/her learning
* The best way is to back off, allow kids to have control and autonomy they crave even if it means struggling with the task or situation at hand. Set the goal firmly, but let children decide how to get there.

#### Autonomy, in Which Kids Find Out That Self-Reliance Feels Great

* Rewards work for repetitive, uncomplicated or boring tasks, but when it comes to creativity and nuanced learning, they are lousy motivators. Rewards inhibits creativity and risk-taking. 
* Control is the enemy of autonomy.
* Let children set their own goals. They must be their own goals, not ours. It provides a private proving ground, a safe way to take risks, fail and try again. 

#### Competence: Confidence Born out of Experience

* Competence requires both <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">ability</span> and <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">experience</span>. Knowing how to manage risk through experience is real, hard-earned competence. 
* Competence and mastery are incredible motivators. Once children get a taste of success, particularly success born of their own efforts and persistence, it becomes addictive. Competence if a self-full-filling prophecy. 
* Once a kid master a skill through his own self-directed efforts, he enters a positive feedback loop that keeps on giving. 
* Competence must come out of a child's own effort. 

#### Connection: Relationships Are What Make Autonomy and Competence Meaningful

* Foster autonomy and competence, and <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">connectedness</span> will follow.
* Over parenting undermines the development of growth mindset because in help our kid to overcome every obstacle, it communicate to our kids that we don't have faith in their ability to grow, improve and surmount challenges and we encourage a fixed mindset. It undermines connectedness by emphasizing control rather than love and support. 

#### Desirable Difficulties Lead to Mastery

* Small failures when the stakes are low and the potential for emotional and cognitive growth is high, are called "<span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Desirable Difficulties</span>".
* We learn by first <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">encoding</span> daily experience into a representation our brain understand, then <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">consolidate</span> them by organizing, sorting and ordering those perceptions into long-term memory that the brain can pull up later and finally, solidify the knowledge through the processing of <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">retrieving</span> the information back out of the brain in order to apply it to novel situations and contexts. 
* Mastery demands retrieval. 
* The easier it is to retrieve information, the less durable the information is in the brain. The harder you have to work to retrieve and apply knowledge in a novel way, the more durably that knowledge will be encoded. 

### Key Points

* External rewards do not motive children. It ok for repetitive and boring tasks, but not for creative work.
* Anything human perceive as controlling is detrimental to long-term motivation and therefore, learning.
* Intrinsic motivate is what drives children to continue learning, to be resilient and not afraid of failure.
* You can help children to better develop intrinsic motivation by giving them <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">autonomy</span>, help them to become <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">competent</span>, build better <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">relationship</span> with them to make the autonomy and competence meaningful (<span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">communication</span>). 

### Practical Steps
* Do not use external rewards to motive your child.
* Back off, and let children work on their own even in difficult situations. 
* Set hard boundaries, but within those boundaries, give them freedom to make their own choice.
* Let children set their own goals. 
* Be honest with children, praise for their resilience and the efforts they make to recover from mistakes. 
* Show kids they are not alone in the world, they matter in the big picture, and their parents are there to support them as they find their place within it.

### Connection

* When children do tasks which they are intrinsically motivated for they are more likely to overcome the obstacles thrown at them and be more resilient to failures. Like playing Minecraft. What would be even better if you can build your own games with programming, and a lot of kids enjoy doing that. So this creates a very good playground for kids to try different solutions and fail and try again until they get what they want. This helps them to develop intrinsic motivation and can then be transferred into other areas in life.
