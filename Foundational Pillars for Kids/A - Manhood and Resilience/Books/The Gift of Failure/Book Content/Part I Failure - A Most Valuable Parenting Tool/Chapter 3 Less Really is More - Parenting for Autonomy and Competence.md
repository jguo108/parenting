### Note

* We have a greater responsibility to our kids than to make them happy and grateful for my love and support. In order to raise competent, capable adults, we have to love them enough to put their learning before our happiness. 
* Autonomy-supportive parents establish specific and clear expectations, make themselves physically and emotionally present, and offer guidance when kids get frustrated or need redirection.  
* Kids thrive on our expectations and they flourish when given responsibilities of their own and the education they need to carry them out successfully. 

#### Creating New Habits

* Assign responsibilities to kids and make those a part of their daily life.
* The process of creating a habit: cue, routine and reward.
* Kids will feel good to be of use in the family and later, in the big wide world.

#### What Controlling Parents Do

* Controlling parents give lots of <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">unsolicited advice</span> and <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">direction</span>. This interferes with the kid's sense of autonomy, conveys a lack of faith in his/her competence, and because it's irritating and upsetting to both of you, undermines your connection. *That's not the right way to load the dishwasher. Always wash the plates before putting them in and stack all the plates on the left side. Don't leave the dishes in the sink and come back later. Do it this way, Do it now. Do it later.* 

* Controlling parents<span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)"> take over</span>. *I'll just do it, you go play. We have to get to school, I will just do it myself when I get home. No, not that way, just let me do it.*

* Controlling parents offer <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">extrinsic motivators</span> in exchange for behaviors. *You get one jelly bean for every toy you clean up. If you walk the dog every morning, I'll buy you new sneakers. If you load and upload the dishwasher for an entire week without being asked, I will get you that video game you've been asking for.*

* Controlling parents provides <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">solutions</span> or the <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">correct answer</span> before the child as had a chance to really struggle with a problem. *But honey, you know five times four is twenty, you just did that down here. I will just look that word up for you while you do the spelling list. Just give me that pencil and I will show you. Not like that, like this.* 

* Controlling parents don't let children make their <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">own decisions</span>. *Do your math first, and then your spelling. Do your homework here at the table where I can see you. You should play tennis rather than baseball this season.* 

#### What Autonomy-Supportive Parents Do

* Autonomy-supportive parents <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">guide</span> children toward solutions. *I know you know that five times three is, so what happens when you add another five? Why do you think the cold glass broke when you poured hot water into it? Try holding the protractor so you can read the numbers right side up.*

* Autonomy-supportive parents <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">allow for mistakes</span> and help children understand the <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">consequences</span> of those mistakes. *It's no big deal that you dropped that glass. I'll show you how to clean it all up, and you can remember to carry fewer next time. Pick out the lumps in the oatmeal, and I will show you how to avoid that mistakes for next time. The mop bucket spilled because it's too short to hold the weight of the mop  handler; just clean up the mess and use the other bucket next time.* 

* Autonomy-supportive parents <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">value the mistakes</span> as much as the successes. *I'm so proud of you for sticking with that worksheet even though it was hard for you. What could you have said to your brother that might helped him understand you rather than throw his toy at you?* 

* Autonomy-supportive parents acknowledge children's <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">feeling of frustration and disappointment</span>. *I get mad, too, when I can't do something right the first time, but I keep trying until I figure it out. Remember yesterday, when I did not get that job I wanted? That was really disappointing, but I know I will figure something else out if I work at it. I can imagine how frustrating this math must be for you, but won't it feel great when you know how to do it?* 

* Autonomy-supportive parents give <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">feedbacks</span>. *Look down at your buttons; something looks off - can you figure out what's wrong? If you forgot to carry the two in that other problem, you made the same mistakes on this problem?* 


### Practice

* <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Cue</span>: After school snack; Routine: <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Complete</span> homework; Reward: <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Feeling</span> of satisfaction of completing homework thoroughly and with best effort. 
* Come in to help your kids only when they are stuck and need your guidance. Outside of that, hold your mouth and let the kids to it. They will make mistakes, let it be, and correct them afterwards as an important learning moments. 
* Keep rewards minimum and space them out to celebrate the child's accomplishments.
* Whenever kids face a problem, give them time and silence to think. 
* Find lessons in failures, help kids to discover new ways to cope and rebound from the mistakes in order to do better next time.
* Empathize and love your kids when they have messed up.
*
