### Note

* We have a greater responsibility to our kids than to make them happy and grateful for my love and support. In order to raise competent, capable adults, we have to love them enough to put their learning before our happiness. 
* Autonomy-supportive parents establish specific and clear expectations, make themselves physically and emotionally present, and offer guidance when kids get frustrated or need redirection.  
* Kids thrive on our expectations and they flourish when given responsibilities of their own and the education they need to carry them out successfully.
