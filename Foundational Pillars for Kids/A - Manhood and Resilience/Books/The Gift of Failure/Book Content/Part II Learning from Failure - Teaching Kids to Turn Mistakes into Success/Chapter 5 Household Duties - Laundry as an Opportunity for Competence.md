### Notes

* Whether we over-parent and protect out of a need for perfectionism, a desire to show affection, or a need to prove our own parenting excellence, we deny our children the opportunity to be full members of the family with their own duties and responsibilities .
* Household participation is a first step toward building a purpose -driven and fulfilling life. 
* Replace the word "chore" with "family contributions". It sends out the message that, when you help out, it makes a big difference for this family. This helps kids to understand his/her significance and purpose. 

#### Great Expectations and Genuine Accountability

* Set clear expectations and hold you kids accountable when they don't meet those expectations. We are an integral art of a cooperative unit, a group of people who depend on each other for both labor and love.

#### Step Away and Hold Your Tongue

*  On the the expectations are outlined, explain that you will not be nagging them until they complete their responsibility. 
* If you go behind your child's back and redo the chore he has just finished, you will be telling him that he is not competent and you will finish the job if he is careless. So don't do this. 

#### Ditch the Lollipops

* Stop using rewards as your strategy. Remove the task from the reward and shift their focus back to internal motivators. Talk about how rewarding it is to do a job well.

#### Household Duties for the Preschool Set

* <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Toddlers</span>: Put dirty cloths on basket, dress themselves with cloths no too complicated, wash simple cloths, put their cloths in the drawers, brush teeth, throw trash, put toys away, put away the dishes. 
* <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Preschoolers</span>: They like counting so give them jobs that encourage them to practice those skills while installing responsibility. 

#### The Habits of Highly Effective School-Age Kids

* Make your child's job a daily event rather than an intermittent expectation. In order to turn the occasional moments of "helping out" into a habit, it must be regular enough to become ingrained as a pattern. 
* To develop any habit, you need three things: <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">cue</span>, <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">routine</span> and <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">reward</span>. 
* For kids age 6  to 11, they are more capable, so help them to see how being proactive around the house can lead to positive effect.

#### With Adolescence Comes Greater Responsibility

* Encouraging teens to be a competent and involved member of the household sets the stage for them to be successful in life. If an adolescents knows that he doesn't have to work for things, this often translate into an inability to work in the real world. Having to be responsible for things at home helps to teach teens what it means to take care of the important thing sin their lives. This will cause teems to have better self-esteem feel more effective, be more productive and be more motivated to continue this into their adult lives.
* Armed with the <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">competence</span>, <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">experience</span>, and the <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">skills</span> they learned by your side, at home, they have the opportunities to <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">fail</span>, to <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">mess up</span> and <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">fix their errors</span>, and won't be fazed by a misstep here and there as young adults. 
* <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Perfection</span> is not what holds a family together, the <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">bond</span> forged through shared <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">struggles</span> is what endures over the long haul.

### Practice

* Brainstorm as a family about jobs the kids are capable of learning and come up with a list of expectations. The expectations have to be clear and age-appropriate. 
* Have a family cleaning day where we all pitch n and then do something fun after.
* Need to make it clear what are my son's responsibilities are and make those a routine of his life.
