### Notes

* One of the most significant aspects of sports is as an arena to learn about and accept failure.

#### The Benefits of Sports off the Field
#### Pressured Parents on the Sidelines

* Relax on the sidelines, it's just a game.
* The trophies, medals and scholarships that we dangle as reward for our children's athletic efforts don't just heighten a sense of competition and anxiety, they undermine drive. Just like rewards for positive behaviors are intrinsic motivation  killers in academic and social contexts, they also dampen participation and enthusiasm in sports and other recreational activities. 
* Parents should be supportive, not pushy

#### A guide to Successful sideline Parenting

* *Be the parent, not the coach*. 
* *Never, ever, bad-mouth the coach in front of your child*. 
* *Don't ask your child to fulfil your athletic dreams*. 
* *Cultivate a growth mindset with plenty of room for failure*.
