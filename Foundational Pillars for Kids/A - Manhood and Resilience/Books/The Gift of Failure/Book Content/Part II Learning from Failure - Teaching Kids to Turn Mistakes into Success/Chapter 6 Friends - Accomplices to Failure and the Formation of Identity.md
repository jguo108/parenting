### Notes
* Peers teach our children how to interact and negotiate with other people, and this education starts when children learn to play cooperatively, respond to the needs of others, and construct their own imaginary worlds. 
* Adults should give kids the space and freedom to learn how to play with other and work out the tough social moments for themselves, because those fights, tussles, silent treatments, and breakups are invaluable opportunities for growth.
* The cost of over-parenting is that the child does not develop the skills to fight back, speak up or get the hell out of the way. The child will not learn valuable communication skills that are necessary during the heat of emotional flooding during an argument. 
* Free play and the social interaction it fosters leads to academic success.
* Friendships are opportunities for kids to develop their own <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">personalities</span>, <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">identities</span>, and choices and for us to gain perspective and feedback on who our children are becoming.

#### The Push and Pull of Playdates
#### Sibling Rivalry and Resolution
#### Playmate Proximity to Playground Politics

* As the influence of their friends begins to gain in power, it's a good time to begin to talk to your child about peer pressure and what he might do it he is placed in a situation that makes him uncomfortable. 
* If we allow kids to mess up, anger other kids, fight and make up, they will learn how to be a good friend, how to stand up for themselves, and how to say no to behaviors that make them uncomfortable. 

#### Friendships in the Middle Years

* Focus shifts from shared interests to social acceptance.
* When parents overreact to everyday social interactions and label it bullying, children never learn hot to push back and demand respect. 
* When your children make have friends who you are not comfortable with, do not try to intervene. Having friends who are very different from your own kid help your child to to develop empathy for differences, or an understanding of how to negotiate and reason with people who come from differing perspectives, worldviews and ethnicities. 

#### Learning from Adolescent Social Angst

* Support, but not control teens through their adolescent relationships. 





### Practices
* Put digital devices away and arrange playdates with a variety of real, live children.
