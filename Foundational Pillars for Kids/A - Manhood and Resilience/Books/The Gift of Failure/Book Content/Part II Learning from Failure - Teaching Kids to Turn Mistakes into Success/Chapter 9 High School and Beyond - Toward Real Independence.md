### Notes

* Our job is not to protect them from their failures along the way, but to help them cope with setbacks as they occur.
* Students in high school transition from the trial-and-error methods younger kids use to a more strategic way of thinking. They can hold multiple possibilities and ideas in their heads at once and consider how those ideas might play out before launching into a plan. 
* Parents need to step back think what kind of "success" we really want for our children. There are all kinds of success, and they mostly boil down to being happy. If we rob our children of their opportunities to fail, we rob them of their opportunities to, ultimately, be happy despite the realities of the economic and political world they will live in because they won't develop the self0confidence and resilience necessary to find creative solutions to challenges in their own lives with their own realities.
