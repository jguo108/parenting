### Notes

* Our job is not to protect them from their failures along the way, but to help them cope with setbacks as they occur.
* Students in high school transition from the trial-and-error methods younger kids use to a more strategic way of thinking. They can hold multiple possibilities and ideas in their heads at once and consider how those ideas might play out before launching into a plan. 
* Parents need to step back think what kind of "success" we really want for our children. There are all kinds of success, and they mostly boil down to being happy. If we rob our children of their opportunities to fail, we rob them of their opportunities to, ultimately, be happy despite the realities of the economic and political world they will live in because they won't develop the self0confidence and resilience necessary to find creative solutions to challenges in their own lives with their own realities.
* Responsibility is best learned when parents step back at the high school level to let the student, by trial and error, advocate, motivate, activate for him or herself. There should be a relatively moderate to high level of autonomy for a student at the high school level to begin to find his/her way to live and experience choice and to safely experience the consequences of personal actions. The important thing is that Mom and Dad are nearby to support from the sidelines, but not to be lead counsel. When parents take the supporting role, but balance it with the ability (and it is a learned skill for parents) to step aside and watch and welcome and expect the student to choose his/her way, students seem to make the better choices relatively quickly if not automatically. Students want to do well. They want to make the right choice . . . but they also want to have the ability to choose.

#### NINTH GRADE: DEER IN THE HEADLIGHTS

* Encourage your kids to capitalize on these sympathies and potential sources of support by talking to their teachers whenever possible. Tell them to: Ask for clarification. Admit when an assignment is confusing. Seek teachers out for extra help. Establish positive relationships. Teachers love it when students take initiative.
* For many ninth graders, the first high school tests, quizzes, and papers will serve as a rude awakening after the relative ease of middle school, and it’s really important for parents to respond with calm reassurance and support, rather than panic. Frame ninth grade for your child as a getting-to-know-you period.

#### TENTH GRADE: MY FAVORITE YEAR

* Tenth grade is a time to settle in and enjoy high school before the pace picks up and love of learning is sacrificed at the altar of SATs and college admissions.
* It introduces the option of electives, the first opportunity students are given to exercise choice over what and when they learn.
* The key word here is _choice_. And it should be theirs, if you want them to find ownership and pride in their learning and growth.

#### ELEVENTH GRADE: CRUNCH TIME

* Give me a kid with a passion for learning, a kid who has demonstrated some measure of autonomy and motivation. Give me a kid who knows his or her mind. But these things are harder to come by if the child has been tutored and handheld from birth.
* Junior year also marks the first time many kids can legally hold jobs, and I’ve met many students who have found autonomy and motivation through employment.
* Encourage your child to reach for things he might not usually try for: an internship, publication in a magazine or newspaper, a part in a play. Push your kid to take risks in that reach, because while he might get rejected 99 times out of 100, that one acceptance, or opportunity, or path, could be the one that leads to a lifelong passion.
#### TWELFTH GRADE: THE FINAL FRONTIER

* One important place to start handing over some control is during the search for a college. Your child’s choice of college is the first, and arguably the most, important decision she will make in her young adult life. Resist the temptation to talk up schools you wish you had attended or the school everyone in your family has attended for the past three generations.
* The autonomous student leaves high school better prepared for the world. He or she leaves a stronger individual with strengthened social and coping skills. A more autonomous student leaves high school with a keen understanding of what works for her as a student and also as a community member in the world at large. She has a strategy to navigate the world. On the other hand, the student who leaves high school as a dependent follower is much less ready for the world at large and much less prepared.
