### Notes

* We don’t have access to spoilers, and we can’t skim through the uncomfortable chapters in our children’s story arcs in order to skip to the happy ending. Worse, we can’t even know if there will _be_ a happy ending.
* What we can do, however, is be patient, and trust in our kids. In order for my children to become masterpieces, their flaws must be allowed to remain, and serve as an essential part of their tale.
