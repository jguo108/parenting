Drawing on the information in the sources, here are some of the most important and frequently referenced interviews, talks, articles, and books in "Raising Mentally Strong Kids":

- **The work and clinical experience of Dr. Daniel G. Amen:** Dr. Amen's extensive experience with **brain SPECT imaging** through **Amen Clinics** is a foundational element of the book. His findings and insights derived from over 250,000 brain scans are frequently referenced to support the connection between brain health and behaviour. His concept of seeing psychiatric problems as "brain health issues" is central to the book's premise.
- **Dr. Amen's books:** Several of Dr. Amen's previous books are frequently referred to, particularly **Change Your Brain, Change Your Life**. Other books like **Healing ADD**, **Memory Rescue**, **Your Brain Is Always Listening**, **You, Happier**, and **Change Your Brain Every Day** are also mentioned, often in relation to specific concepts like the BRIGHT MINDS mnemonic or the One Page Miracle. His children's book, **Captain Snout and the Superpower Questions**, is also referenced.
- **The Love and Logic approach, pioneered by Jim Fay and Foster Cline:** The principles of **Love and Logic** are deeply integrated throughout the book and are presented as a crucial psychological component for raising mentally strong kids, complementing the neuroscience insights of Dr. Amen. The foundational ideas and techniques of Love and Logic are referenced in various chapters, often without citing specific publications each time, but the overall philosophy is consistently present. Jim Fay is explicitly mentioned in the Foreword and Introduction, highlighting his decades of experience.
- **The concept of ANTs (Automatic Negative Thoughts), coined by Dr. Amen:** This is a recurring and important concept throughout the book, with a dedicated chapter (Chapter 7) and frequent mentions in other sections when discussing mental hygiene and emotional regulation for both parents and children.
- **The BRIGHT MINDS mnemonic:** Developed by Dr. Amen, this framework for understanding and addressing risk factors for brain health (Blood flow, Rational thinking, Inflammation, Genetics, Head trauma, Toxins, Mental health, Immunity and infection, Neurohormones, Diet, Sleep) is introduced early and referenced in subsequent chapters when discussing practical strategies for brain health.
- **The One Page Miracle (OPM):** This goal-setting exercise developed by Dr. Amen is presented as a key tool for parents and children to focus on their aspirations and align their behaviour accordingly. It is described in detail and referenced as a practical step for achieving goals and building mental strength.
- **Diana Baumrind's research on parenting styles:** Her foundational work on different parenting styles (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and neglectful) is discussed as a framework for understanding how parenting approaches can impact a child's development and mental strength.
- **Jim Fay's audio-cassette "Helicopters, Drill Sergeants, and Consultants: Parenting Styles and the Messages They Send":** This work is specifically cited when introducing the concepts of helicopter and drill sergeant parenting styles.

While other books and research are mentioned (as noted in our previous conversation), these listed items appear to be the most central and frequently referenced, forming the core theoretical and practical framework of "Raising Mentally Strong Kids". The authors consistently draw upon Dr. Amen's brain science expertise and the practical parenting strategies of the Love and Logic approach.
