Based on the provided excerpts from "Raising Mentally Strong Kids" by Daniel G. Amen and Charles Fay, the authors do identify and address several potential critiques or opposing views, often by presenting their own science-based or experience-backed approaches as more effective. Here are some examples:

- **Traditional Parenting Methods (Rant, Rave, and Rescue):** Jim Fay, in the foreword, reflects on his early parenting using "old traditional methods of rant, rave, and rescue". He notes that these methods "worked with sweet, compliant kids but often backfired with strong-willed and stubborn kids". This implicitly acknowledges a common, traditional approach and refutes its universal effectiveness based on experience. The book then goes on to present alternative, "innovative" and "science-based" strategies.
    
- **Negative Bias Against ADHD Medication:** Dr. Amen addresses the common parental concern of "drugging" their child when considering medication for ADHD. He refutes this view by pointing out that psychiatric and learning disorders are "actually brain health problems" and that for ADHD, there can be specific types requiring targeted interventions, including medication. He emphasises seeking well-informed specialists rather than dismissing such treatments based on general biases.
    
- **Overly Permissive Parenting:** The book explicitly states that "Multiple studies have demonstrated that the children who grow up to have the most psychological problems had parents who never set appropriate boundaries". This directly counters a permissive parenting style by citing research (though the specific studies aren't detailed in the excerpts) to support the necessity of limits and rules.
    
- **Focusing Solely on Weaknesses:** Dr. Fay discusses how many well-meaning parents focus on continually pointing out what their child is doing wrong, believing it is their responsibility. The book refutes this by highlighting the importance of celebrating strengths and using specific feedback related to effort rather than general, potentially demotivating praise like "You are so smart". This is supported by the research of Dr. Carol Dweck on growth versus fixed mindsets.
    
- **Telling Kids They Are Smart:** The authors argue against telling children they are smart, suggesting that when these children inevitably face challenges, they may conclude they are not actually smart and give up. Instead, they advocate for praising effort and hard work, which fosters perseverance. This refutes a common form of parental encouragement by presenting a logical consequence based on the development of self-esteem and resilience.
    
- **Parental Conflict and "Getting on the Same Page":** The book acknowledges the common advice for parents to "get on the same page" regarding parenting styles. However, it refutes the practicality and potential for conflict arising from trying to control or perfect the other parent's approach. Instead, the authors advocate for establishing shared goals and being more flexible on how those goals are achieved, embracing the different personalities and skill sets of each parent. This addresses a common parental challenge with a more nuanced and relationship-focused solution.
    

In summary, the authors of "Raising Mentally Strong Kids" do address potential critiques or opposing viewpoints by drawing on **research findings in psychology and neuroscience**, as well as their **extensive clinical experience**. They often present their own approaches as more effective in fostering resilience, responsibility, and mental strength in children compared to traditional or less informed parenting practices. They use **logic** by explaining the potential negative consequences of certain approaches and the positive outcomes associated with their recommended strategies.
