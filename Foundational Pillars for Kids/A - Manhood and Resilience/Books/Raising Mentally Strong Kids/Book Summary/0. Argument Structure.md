Based on summaries and reviews of "Raising Mentally Strong Kids" by Daniel G. Amen and Charles Fay, the book appears to primarily use a combination of the following argument structures from your list:

1. **Problem-Solution (1):** The book clearly identifies the challenge (problem) of raising children to be mentally strong, confident, kind, responsible, and resilient in today's complex world. It then proposes numerous strategies, techniques, and principles (solutions) grounded in neuroscience and the Love & Logic philosophy.
2. **List-Based (8):** This structure seems very prominent. Multiple sources mention specific lists presented in the book, such as "Eight Essential Rules for Kids," "33 Best Tips," the "BRIGHT MINDS" mnemonic for brain health factors, the "Four Steps to Responsibility," food rules, digital media tips, and action steps often included at the end of chapters.
3. **Analytical (9):** The book breaks down the complex topic of child development and mental strength by analyzing the role of brain health and function (neuroscience) and integrating it with established parenting psychology (Love & Logic). It examines _how_ and _why_ certain parenting approaches impact a child's developing brain and subsequent behaviour.
4. **Thesis-Support (6):** There is a central thesis that effectively raising mentally strong children requires addressing both the brain (neuroscience) and the mind (psychology, behaviour, environment). The rest of the book provides the evidence (brain science) and practical methods (rules, steps, strategies derived from Love & Logic) to support this core claim.

While other structures might appear supportively (like **Narrative/Story-Driven** through anecdotes or **Thematic** organization within chapters around concepts like discipline or resilience), the combination of identifying problems, providing list-based strategies, analyzing the underlying neuroscience, and supporting a central thesis appears to be the dominant structural approach.
