### Questions to Think About

- What are some things you do yourself, instead of involving your kids, because you know you can do it faster? Could there be opportunities in these spaces for them to lean valuable things?
- Do you think the size roles are comprehensive, or are there other roles that come to mind?
- Which roles do you think you are strong at, and which are more challenging for you?
