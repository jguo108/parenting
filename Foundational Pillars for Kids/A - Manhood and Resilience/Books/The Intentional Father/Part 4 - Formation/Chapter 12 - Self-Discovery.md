# Chapter 12 - Self-Discovery

### Principle

*Our goal as fathers is to help our sons discover who God has made and called them to be. We are not to make them in our own image but to help them along the path of grace so that they are renewed in the image of their Creator. This will bring them confidence and vision to move forward.* 

### Notes

#### Identity
* Who you are, what are your strengths, what are your spiritual gifts, what are your weaknesses. A good way to discover this is to take as many personality and skill tests as you can.
#### Test and Evaluations
* The Enneagram personality test
* StrengthsFinder test
* Spiritual Gifts assessment
* APEST test
* Myers-Briggs personality test
* Birkman test |

### Questions to Think About

- How well do you know yourself? How has this self-awareness helped you make important decisions?
- What are some of the big decisions you see your teenager needing to make in the coming years, and how do you hope that better self-awareness will help him make better decisions?

### Intentional Steps

For each test you plan to have with your son, as the following questions:
- What are the results?
- What does this mean?
- What does it explain?
- What does it have implications for?
- What does it help others know?
