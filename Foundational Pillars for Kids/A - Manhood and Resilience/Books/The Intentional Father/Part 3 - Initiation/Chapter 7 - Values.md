# Chapter 7 - Values

### Principle

*Without values, a man is rudderless in a sea of relativity and compromise. With values, a man can navigate complexity and confusion with confidence and clarity. Infusing values - those of the family, those of manhood and personal ones - is a great gift from a father to a son.*

### Notes

#### What are values?
* What makes us? What makes our family tick? Who are we?
#### What are the three important values
* Family Values. Discuss with your son about what they think is the highest family value(s).
* Personal Values. They often derived from the “mountains and valleys” of your timeline. What matters to you as an adult? The author’s four main values are: vision, passion, discipline and risk.
* Masculine Values. Wisdom, self-control, courage, and justice
#### What to do?
* Write all those values down and intentionally model them in your own life and pass them down to your son.

### Questions to Think About

### Intentional Steps

- Talk with your son about what you each think to be the values of your family
- Review your mountains and valleys and understand the values you get from those
