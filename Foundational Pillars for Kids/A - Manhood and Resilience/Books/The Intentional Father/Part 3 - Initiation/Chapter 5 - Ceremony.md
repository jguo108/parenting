# Chapter 5 - Ceremony

### Principle

*Adolescent boys need to know they are being invited into a journey of growth and development out of childhood and into manhood. there needs to be a definitive break from normal life into liminal space where they can emerge and grow as men.*

### Notes

#### Ceremony (Initiation)
* Have some special events with your son that would mark the beginning of his journey into manhood.

### Questions to Think About

- How do you think your son would respond to you creating an international transformational path of for him to journey along?
- What features of the way I set up the experience so far do you think would work with your son? What would you choose to do differently.
