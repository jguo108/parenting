Here are five potentially weaker claims in the book, along with counterarguments and suggestions for better evidence within the constraints of the provided text and general knowledge (clearly marked as such):

- **Weak Claim 1:** The absolute correlation between a sense of control and success in all aspects of life.
    
    - **Quote the original text:** "_Stress tolerance is highly correlated to success in all aspects of life._"
    - **Provide counterarguments from peer-reviewed studies:** While the book cites research on the positive effects of perceived control on stress and well-being, claiming it's "highly correlated to success in all aspects of life" is a very broad and potentially oversimplified statement. **(Note: This level of generality lacks specific peer-reviewed backing within the provided sources for _all_ aspects of life. External research, which you should independently verify, suggests that while a sense of control is beneficial, other factors such as socio-economic background, talent, luck, and systemic inequalities also play significant roles in various definitions of success.)**
    - **Suggest better evidence the author could have used:** The authors could have qualified this statement by specifying the _domains_ of life where a sense of control has strong empirical support (e.g., academic performance, mental health, stress management, as suggested by their cited research). They could also acknowledge the multi-faceted nature of "success" and mention other contributing factors, even if outside the scope of their central argument.
- **Weak Claim 2:** The broad assertion that earlier academic learning is not necessarily better and can be harmful with no lasting benefit.
    
    - **Quote the original text:** "_The central, critical message here is a counterintuitive one that all parents would do well to internalize: earlier isn’t necessarily better; and likewise, more isn’t better if it’s too much._" and the anecdote about Bill's daughter.
    - **Provide counterarguments from peer-reviewed studies:** While the authors provide a personal anecdote and mention easier reading at age seven versus five, this doesn't represent the complexity of early childhood education research. **(Note: Within the provided sources, there isn't a robust discussion of peer-reviewed studies that definitively prove "no lasting benefit" from all forms of earlier learning. External research, which you should independently verify, on early childhood interventions often shows long-term positive effects on various developmental outcomes, although the intensity and appropriateness of early learning are crucial factors.)** The claim of "no lasting benefit" seems absolute and might not account for individual differences and well-designed early learning programs.
    - **Suggest better evidence the author could have used:** Instead of a broad statement, the authors could have cited specific studies comparing the long-term academic outcomes of children who started formal learning at different ages within developmentally appropriate curricula. They could also discuss the potential downsides of _pressurised_ or developmentally _inappropriate_ early learning, rather than dismissing all earlier learning.
- **Weak Claim 3:** The seemingly absolute statement that "you can’t make someone do something against his will."
    
    - **Quote the original text:** "_When we make the point in lectures that you can’t make someone do something against his will, many people will nod their heads in agreement, as if this were completely obvious. But others will vehemently disagree._" and the subsequent examples.
    - **Provide counterarguments from peer-reviewed studies:** While the authors illustrate the difficulty of _forcing_ intrinsic motivation, the concept of "will" and the influence of external factors are more complex. **(Note: The provided text doesn't engage with the vast literature on compliance, obedience, and the impact of authority or social pressures on behaviour. External research, which you should independently verify, in social psychology demonstrates that people can be influenced and made to act against their initial preferences or desires through various means, even if it doesn't equate to genuine internal motivation.)** The authors' examples focus on extreme physical force, which is different from other forms of influence.
    - **Suggest better evidence the author could have used:** The authors could have nuanced their statement by acknowledging the difference between forced compliance and intrinsic motivation. They could have discussed how external pressures can lead to outward behaviour change, even if internal resistance remains.
- **Weak Claim 4:** The general assertion of a low correlation between grades in school and success in life.
    
    - **Quote the original text:** "_When Bill’s kids were in elementary school, he made a point of telling them that there was a low correlation between grades in school and success in life._"
    - **Provide counterarguments from peer-reviewed studies:** While the book presents this as a truth Bill shared with his children, the strength and nature of the correlation between academic grades and later life success (depending on how "success" is defined) is a complex and debated topic in social science. **(Note: The provided text offers this as an assertion without citing specific broad-based studies to support a "low correlation" across various measures of success. External research, which you should independently verify, often shows a moderate correlation between educational attainment (which grades contribute to) and factors like income and career opportunities, although this relationship is not deterministic and other factors are crucial.)** An individual anecdote about later PhD attainment despite an "unrushed start" doesn't establish a low general correlation.
    - **Suggest better evidence the author could have used:** The authors could have cited large-scale longitudinal studies that have examined the relationship between academic performance in school and various indicators of adult success, acknowledging the nuances and limitations of such research.
- **Weak Claim 5:** The somewhat simplistic presentation of meditation as a readily embraced tool for older children and teens if framed correctly.
    
    - **Quote the original text:** "_In our experience, many older children, adolescents, and young adults will meditate on their own if they are taught to see meditation as a tool that can alleviate their physical or emotional pain and/or improve their school performance, or if it is part of the daily routine practiced by the whole family._"
    - **Provide counterarguments from peer-reviewed studies:** While the book cites studies on the benefits of meditation for children and adolescents, the ease of adoption described might be overoptimistic. **(Note: External research, which you should independently verify, on adherence to meditation practices, especially among adolescents, often highlights challenges related to motivation, time constraints, and perceived benefits. While framing meditation positively is helpful, it doesn't guarantee adoption.)** Individual interest and buy-in can vary significantly. The success of programs like "Quiet Time" in specific school settings might not translate universally.
    - **Suggest better evidence the author could have used:** The authors could have included a more nuanced discussion of the challenges involved in introducing meditation to older children and teens, perhaps citing studies on factors that predict successful adoption and maintenance of such practices. Acknowledging potential resistance and offering strategies for overcoming it beyond just explaining the benefits would have strengthened this claim.
