### Notes

#### Which Wrong is More Right?

* Ask students to look at a minimum of two incorrect answers to ask which one is *more “right.”*
* First, students would need to develop the most *innocent interpretation* of their side’s mistake. Then, they would need to think about the most *moronic interpretation* of the other side’s mistake.
* Students are no longer asking “*what*” and “*how to*.” They are now in the world of “*why*” and “*what if*.” They are going beyond metacognition, where they think about their own thinking processes. They are now analyzing the hypothetical thinking patterns of others and evaluating those patterns against each other.

#### What Would Joe Schmo Do?

* Joe always falls for the trick answer. Joe does not read the directions carefully. Joe does not complete all of the steps in a problem.
* We ask students to prepare their own multiple-choice responses to a question, constrain their options to only include responses that someone like Joe Schmo can plausibly come up with. This way, we are asking them to make reasonable predictions and inferences. We are helping them develop the habit of putting themselves in the shoes of others to become more empathetic. Practically speaking, we are creating a world where students actually look forward to test prep season.

### Practices

* When asking my son to look into  mistakes or errors someone else has made, not only ask him to find what that mistakes are, but also ask him to think about why people made such mistake, what was their thinking process, what deficiency in their understanding that could lead to such mistake
