### Notes

* We need to ensure students have the tools to transition from having a gut feeling to formulating an informed opinion.
* Asking good questions is not enough. We also want to make sure students can ask good questions of themselves. We want them to build research instincts, creating healthy voices inside their heads that ask questions like these: 
    - *Where do I start?*
    - *What do I know already?*
    - *What I do next?*
    - *How do I know that’s true?*
    - *Why should I believe you?*
    - *What’s really going on here?*
    - *What else do I need to know?*

#### Too Hot to Handle

* Pressing pause is powerful. During that period, we can make predictions and inferences. We are applying background knowledge to develop a complex, detailed potential timeline. This is no different than the type of brainstorming lawyers do when they first receive a case; all they know are small details from the client’s version of what happened or the information on a police report.
* When gathering witnesses for more evidence, always think (1) how will this witness’s testimony impact the case, and (2) how might this witness be biased? Thinking of these witnesses will help lead us toward evidence we need to collect.

### Practices

#### English Language and Arts

*  “Press pause” while reading to ask students to make predictions and inferences about what might happen next. 
* Start reading a poem or book from the last line or last page as a strategy to get students to work backward to predict the beginning and middle of a piece based on the ending.
* Have students write or tell stories entirely based on the images of a picture book before they read the book or have the book read to them.
* When learning new grammar rules, have students predict what they think the grammatical rule is, and give them more examples of what is a proper use of this rule and what is not until they can articulate what the rule is.

#### Math

* For any math vocabulary word that can be understood through patterns and trends, like functions, *prime numbers*, or square roots, use discovery to get students to predict the definition. 

#### Social Studies

* When studying a war, use an incomplete timeline and ask students to predict conflicts that happened in the leadup to the war.

#### Science and Career and Technical Education

* Instead of classifying igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rock by memorizing definitions, have students analyze different types of rocks and classify them into groups on their own. You can ask them to look for key characteristics, like crystals, glassy surfaces, ribbon/stripe-like layers, gas bubbles, and sand or pebbles. Once they start to sort these rocks into categories, there’s a much better chance they will remember the properties of the three different types of rocks because of the deeper appreciation that comes from learning the rules through the experimentation process. A similar discovery process can be used for any topic in Career and Technical Education.

### Foreign Language

#### Foreign Language

* Students can watch a conversation between two people speaking a foreign language using some combination of unknown vocabulary and unknown concepts, and based on mood, body language, and pre-existing knowledge of vocabulary, they can predict what they believe the conversation was about. Then, once you teach the concept and new vocabulary, students can piece together the story bit by bit as if they were cracking a case.

#### Fine Arts

* For any genre, era, or style of art or music, you can have students classify like groups and determine the characteristics of what makes each of these alike. Then you can provide more information and details about what makes a piece from the Baroque Era sound Baroque, what makes an impressionist piece of art impressionist, etc.
