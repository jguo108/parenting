### Notes

* When people are trained to think like lawyers, they cannot help but approach problems and solutions from multiple angles. As a habit, they ask questions until they get the information they need. It becomes almost instinctual to make different claims and find ways to support these claims with valid and relevant evidence.

#### Validity and Relevance

* When faced with a legal issue, our goal should be to make a *persuasive claim* and then determine how to *support* that claim with *evidence* that was both valid and relevant. _Valid_ means that the evidence used had to be *accurate* and *reliable*. _Relevant_ means the evidence actually supported the claim.
* This is not about teaching our students to think of everything they hear as a giant conspiracy theory. It’s about ensuring students have a healthy enough sense of *skepticism* to insist that facts appear to be valid and reliable.
* Picking apart “facts” is a powerful critical thinking trait that is part and parcel of the thinkLaw framework because it matters for life, academics, and career.

#### Considering Multiple Perspectives

* To identify the most significant areas of contention and truly analyze each side of the argument.
* T develop persuasive, strong arguments for different perspectives.

#### Weighing Consequences

* Making a claim -> Making sure the claim was valid and relevant -> Considering different perspectives -> Weighing consequences -> Drawing a conclusion based on this analysis
* When you give students the ability to not just analyze the way the world is, but the critical thinking tools to question the way the world ought to be, students reach a different level of motivation.
* Top students are often so conditioned to find the “right” answer that navigating a world that is more gray than black-and-white is challenging.
