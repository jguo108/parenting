### Notes

1. Multiple perspective analysis unlocks students’ *motivation* and *agency*.
2. Multiple perspective analysis provides a practical tool to build *empathy* at a time when *social-emotional learning* (SEL) is more important than ever.
3. Multiple perspective analysis is the foundation of thinkLaw’s framework for critical thinking across grade levels and subject areas.

#### Motivation and Agency

* The issue is not that students do not have grit. In so many ways, our students have more grit than we could ever imagine. Our challenge as educators is: *how do we create frequent opportunities for students to exercise their grittiness*?

#### Building Empathy

* The simple exercise of developing a *plausible argument* for a side you *do not agree with* is a powerful tool.
* The ability to put oneself in the shoes of others to experience a conflict from their point of view is the essence of empathy.

#### The thinkLaw Framework: DRAAW+C

* *Making a claim* -> *Making sure the claim was valid and relevant* -> *Considering different perspectives* -> *Weighing consequences* -> *Drawing* *a conclusion based on this analysis*
* <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Firstly</span>, Students should consider *multiple perspectives*. They will want to serve as a true devil’s advocate for the opposing claim to help guide their thinking.
* <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Then</span>, they should make sure they think about the *consequences* of their decision. Asking “*what would the world look like if…*” helps students to see beyond the issue right in front of them and visualize the potential impact. How might their decision alter a long-standing rule or norm? Is this one of the issues where the consequences of being right are less important than doing right?
* <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Finally</span>, students’ conclusions should flow directly from this analysis. Often, students approach this the other way; they know the conclusion they want, so they move heaven and earth to reach this conclusion. They cite dubious sources that they know are not valid or bring in random evidence that has nothing to do with the claim in question. They stack the deck with nothing but information that supports their side. The only consequence they care about is the consequence of not reaching their desired outcome.

#### DRAAW+C

* *D* - Decision: Who should win? (*Claim*)
* *R* - Rule/Law: What is the rule or law for this case? (*Rule, law, property of Math, rule of grammar, theory of science or any other logical basis for the claim*)
* *A* - Arguments Plantiff will make: All evidence, facts, and arguments the person bringing the lawsuit will use (*Argument*)
* *A* - Arguments Defendant will make: All evidence, facts, and arguments the person defending the lawsuit will use (*Counter-argument*)
* *W* - World: Looking at the big picture, why is your decision better for the world than the other possible decision
* *C* - Conclusion: Rewrite the decision as a conclusion. Summarizes the key arguments without raising new points not discussed in the preceding sections.

#### Example

* Goldilocks is the shadiest fairy tail character of all time.
