### Notes

* Â The sheer quantity of information, matched with the vast amount of unreliable online sources, makes the process of determining the truth challenging. Additionally, social media algorithms tend to surround us with more of the viewpoints we agree with and make us less open to understanding different points of view.
* Students cared more about grades and rankings than the process of learning itself.
* Students struggled to disagree without being disagreeable, leading to damaging school culture.
* Closing the critical thinking gap for all students is our only hope for giving all students access to 21st-century opportunities.
