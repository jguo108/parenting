### Notes

* It's very hard to have a teaching method for a group of students whose effect can match that of the one-to-one tutoring (*Two Sigma problem*) So, a powerful, adaptable and cheap personalized tutor is the holy grail of education. 
* AI may force us to learn more facts, not fewer, in school. And they will destroy the way we teach before they improve it.

#### After the Homework Apocalypse

* More and more students are using AI to help with their homework. So it's think to rethink education and consider what is cheating and what is not. 
* Debate over the use of calculators in classroom. Just as calculators did not replace the need for learning math, AI will not replace the need for learning to write and think critically.
* AI provides the chance to generate new approaches to pedagogy that push students in ambitious ways.
* School should teach AI literacy and prompt engineering

#### Teaching about AI

* Give AI a role when you talk with it to avoid generic answers
* It can help to give the AI explicit instructions that go step by step through what you want. One approach, called *chain-of-thought* prompting, gives the AI an example of how you want it to reason, before you make your request. Even more usefully, you can also provide step-by-step instructions that build on each other, making it easier to check the output of each step (letting you refine the prompt later), and which will tend to make the output of your prompts more accurate.
* Here is an example: let’s say I wanted to include a good analogy of an AI tutor. Here is a good prompt: **Think this through step by step: come up with good analogies for an AI tutor. First, list possible analogies. Second, critique the list and add three more analogies. Next, create a table listing pluses and minuses of each. Next, pick the best and explain it.**
* But as AI is improving fast, good promoting is going to be less and less important. 
* Rather than distorting our education system around learning to work with AI via prompt engineering, we need to focus on teaching students to be the *humans* in the loop, bringing their *own expertise* to bear on problems.

#### Flipped Classrooms and AI Tutors

* In the future, AI cheating will still be very common, AI tutor will be excellent but not a replacement for school
* What classrooms can offer in the future: opportunities to practice learned skills, collaborate on problem-solving, socialize, and receive support from instructors. School will continue to add value, even with excellent AI tutors.
* In the short term, AI can help teachers to prepare more engaging, organized lectures and make lectures more active
* Active learning is a much more effect way to learn than the traditional passing learning, such as lectures.
* One approach (*Flipped Classroom*) to combine *passive* and *active* learning is that students learn new concepts at home (passive) and then apply what they've learned in the classroom through collaborative activities, discussions, or program-solving exercises (active).
* AI systems can help teachers generate customized active learning experiences to make classes more interesting, from games and activities to assessments and simulations.
* AI tutors can tailor instruction to each student’s unique needs while continually adjusting content based on performance. This means that students can engage with the content at home more effectively, ensuring they come to class better prepared and ready to dive into hands-on activities or discussions.

### Summary

The two-sigma problem shows that personal tutoring is very challenging but at the same time rewarding. While all previous technologies fall short of delivering their promise, AI is likely to change that. AI has already been widely used in education. But unfortunately, this leads to widespread cheating. This forces schools and educator to rethink what education should really be about and how we can better use AI:

* First, e should embrace AI and teach students AI literacy, including prompt engineering techniques to get the most out of AI. But this is probably going to be less relevant as AI becomes better and better in the future. 
* Secondly, teacher can use AI to better organize materials, prepare lectures, and make traditional classroom more engaging and active. 
* Thirdly, we should employ the *Flipped-Classroom* approach where students do self learning at home with the help of AI to grasp basic concepts and come to classroom to participate in active learning, such as group discussion, collaborative problem solving etc. 

Overall, AI is going to be of great value for education. It can provide cheap and scalable personalize teaching to the mass. But it is not going to be a replacement for human teachers. We still need human expertise to deliver good learning experience to students.
