### Notes

* AI is very different from traditional software: it's unpredictable and unreliable, we don't know how it works, and it does not come with a manual.
* Treating AI as a person can improve your understanding how how and when to use it.
* AI excels tasks that are intensively human: *writing*, *analyzing*, *coding* and *chatting*. 
* They not only process and analyze data but also appear to make nuanced judgments, parse complex concepts, and adapt their responses based on the information they are given.

#### Imitation Game

* ELIZZA, PARRY, Eugene Gootsman, Tay

#### Three Conversations

* AI can adapt to different *styles* and create the illusion of *sentience*.
* In one conversation, AI appears to be able to identify the feelings and motivations of other people. The ability to predict what others are thinking is called *theory of mind*, and it is considered exclusive to humans (and possibly,Â under some circumstances, great apes).
* In the second conversation, simply change the role of AI to a teacher, the tone has completely changed. 
* In the third conversation, AI acts like a emotionless machines.

#### Sparks

* AI can be a companion (Replika)

### Summary

After a long history of pursuing true machine intelligence, we have finally come up with an AI that can easily pass the Turing Test. But that does not mean this AI is sentient, and in fact, it is not. It's just a computer program, unlike any traditional software, that is good at many human tasks such as: writing, analyzing, coding and chatting. But it can also easily create the illusion of sentience when we interact with it, such as the AI companion example of Replika, this is inevitable. We just need to be aware that AI is not human, it just works in the way that we would expect human to act. 

AI is not sentient, but often, it can create the illusion of sentience when we interact with it. So we should not bog down to the argument of whether AI is truly sentient or not, we just need to be aware that it is not human, but can be treated like a human.
