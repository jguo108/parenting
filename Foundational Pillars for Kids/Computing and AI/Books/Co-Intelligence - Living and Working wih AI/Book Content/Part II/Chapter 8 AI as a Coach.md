### Notes

* As more and more experience professionals choose to use AI to help them with the basic tasks, we are in danger of stopping the pipeline that creates experts. 

#### Building Expertise in the Age of AI

* We might think that, with AI, it becomes less important to learn the basic facts. But it's quite the contrary: the path to expertise requires a grounding in facts. 
* Learning any skill and mastering any domain requires *rote memorization*, *careful skills building*, and *purposeful practice*, and the AI will undoubtedly be better than a novice at many early skills.
* But, in order to learn to *think critically*, *problem-solve*, *understand abstract concepts*, *reason through novel problems*, and *evaluate the AI’s output*, we need subject matter expertise. The closer we move to a world in which the AI augments our work, the more we need to maintain and nurture *human expertise*. 
* What it takes to build expertise: First, it requires a *basis of knowledge*. We need to learn many facts and understand how they are connected. After that, we have to *practice*. Experts become experts through deliberate practice, which requires serious engagement and a continual ratcheting up of difficulty.
* Today’s AI can make a pretty impressive coach in limited ways, offering timely encouragement, instruction, and other elements of deliberate practice. These are all important elements for someone to transition from a novice to an expert. 

#### When Everyone is an Expert

* Not everyone can become an expert in *everything*. *Talent* also plays a role.
* A large part of schooling and work is focused on getting people to this highly skilled state. However, people who are good at one skill may not be good at another. Modern professional work consists of a wide range of activities rather than a single specialization.
* A human working with an AI co-intelligence outperforms all but the best humans working without an AI.
* But this does not mean the death of expertise: jobs don’t consist of just one automatable task, but rather a set of complex tasks that still require human judgment. What AI does enable is to allow workers to focus on building and honing a narrow slice of area expertise, becoming the human in the loop.
* But it is possible that there may be a new type of expert arising: the ability to work with AI can itself be a form of expertise. 

### Summary

Traditionally, people grow from novice to expert in any field by following someone more experience and get coaching from them for many years. But with the arrival of AI, the experts are more willing to get the basic task done by AI than by some fresh graduate. This can prevent those novice to becoming experts. 

To become an expert, we need both *basis of knowledge* and *deliberate practice*. Unlike what people normally think, we still need to learn basic facts if we want to become an expert. An understanding of how those facts are connected is crucial for becoming an expert. But we also need deliberate practice. Practice that has a purpose, with increasing difficulty,  and prompt feedbacks. Luckily with the help of AI, both can be achieved easily even if you don't have a real human mentor.

People cannot be an expert in all fields. We each have our own specialty. But an expert worker in the future requires the ability to handle wildly different tasks. With the help of AI, workers with lower capability can now level the play field and become an expert.
