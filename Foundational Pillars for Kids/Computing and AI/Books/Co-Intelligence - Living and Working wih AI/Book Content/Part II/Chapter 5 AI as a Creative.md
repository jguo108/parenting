### Key Words

hallucination, bias, creativity, innovation, connection, meaning

### Notes

* AI's biggest weakness is *hallucinations*.  This can result from an exact recall of information. Hallucination is the result of both the technical details of the model, such as how the next word is picked without actually understanding what that word means, and the data the model is trained from, which can contain wrong information or biases. 
* Hallucination won't go away, but it will become less common in future models
* But hallucination always gives AI incredible amount of  *creativity*. The question is how to take advantage of this creativity while avoiding all the pitfalls. 

#### Automatic Creativity

* Breakthrough is the result of combining multiple existing ideas. Seeing the connections between concepts.
* AI is a *connection machine.* It is very good at coming up with novel combinations of tokens that might seem weird to humans, but actually represent something creative
* AI beats human in AUT (*Alternative Use Test*) tests, which ask people to come up with as many different ways as possible to use a everyday object, such as a paper clip
* Another test for creativity is RAT (*Remote Associates Test*) where people are asked to find the common word that connects a set of three seemingly unrelated words. And AI is doing much better than human in this test too!

#### Out-Inventing Humans

* Some people are much more creative than others. But AI is now give those who are less creative a chance to come up with many more idea than they would ever imagine.
* To make AI's answer more creative, give it a specific role and a specific target audience

#### Adding AI to Creative Work

* AI is good at writing of any sort
* AI is good at coding
* AI is good at summarizing and data analysis (use in finance)
* AI's ability to create art work requires us to rethink what art really is
* Good writers are someone who can get the most out of AI. Same with image generation. But you need to be someone who knows what to ask for. 
* For example, to get a good photo from AI, you need to know the basics of light, composition, color, photography style etc etc

#### The Meaning of Creative Work

* AI is giving people new modes of expression and new languages for their creative impulses
* It makes people who were previously less creative to be more confident with their work
* But if anything is at the click on one button, it could potentially limit our creativity because we tend to settle on whatever the first suggestion AI gives. We would not explore different ideas and perspectives
* Another danger is that it could reduce the quality and depth of our thinking and reasoning. We no longer engage in critical and reflective thinking. We also miss the opportunities to learn from mistakes and develop our own style. 
* Work we deem creative and worthy is often because we spending a lot of time, thought and effort into it. But if now everything comes with a click of a button, then what is the meaning of creative work?

### Summary

AI has its weakness, most prominent ones being hallucination and biases. But it's exactly because of this hallucination that AI is very suitable for creative work and it has already been shown that AI outperform human in many tasks that requires creativity. So as humans, we need to embrace AI in our creative work, whether it's writing, creating images, composing music. This gives people tremendous power to become creative and innovative. But at the same time, this leads to a serious question: what is the meaning of creative work? Historically, we associate the time, thought and effect we put into our work with creativity. But if everything is at the click of one button, and the resulting work is both more creative and of higher quality than its human counterpart, what is the meaning of creative work after all?  

So *what should be the meaning of creative work in the AI era*? I don't know the answer!
