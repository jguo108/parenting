### Notes

* Four possible futures.

#### Scenario 1: As Good as It Gets

* AI technology stops progressing due to either technical reason or legal reason. 
* Even if AI stops growing, some implications are already inevitable. First is how we understand and misunderstand the world (fake information). Second is our personal relationship with AI (conversation with AI). Third is AI's impact to creative and analytic work. 
* In most cases, AI would not replace humans. They are just not good enough in their understanding of context, nuance, and planning.

#### Scenario 2: Slow Growth

* There could be a chance that, after its initial exponential growth, the pace of AI growth eventually flatten. With such a more linear change, we can see the future coming and plan for it
* When AI's use become more dangerous, companies and governments have time to react with counter technologies and regulations. 
* Work and industries will be continuously disrupted by AI.
* AI and spur a new wave of innovations.
* AI comes to take a larger and larger role in our lives but gradually enough that disruption is manageable. We also start to see some of the major benefits of AI as well: faster scientific discovery, increased productivity growth, and more educational opportunities for people all over the world. The results are mixed, but largely positive. And humans remain in control of the direction that AI takes.

#### Scenario 3: Exponential Growth

* Companies can use AI to help developing the next generation AI, entering into a Flywheel. 
* Risks are more severe and less predictable. Governments do not have time to adjust in the usual way. We can only have bad AIs held in check by good AIs.
* AI companions become far more compelling to speak with than most other people, and can communicate seamlessly with us in real time, a change that happens faster than anyone expected. But new forms of social isolation emerge, in which some people would rather interact with AIs than with humans.
* Shortened workweeks, universal basic income, and other policy changes might become a reality as the need for human work decreases over time. We will need to find new ways to occupy our free time in meaningful ways, since so much of our current life is focused around work.
* At a certain level of AI ability, they reach a take-off point, achieving AGI and even superhuman intelligence.

#### Scenario 4: The Machine God

* In this fourth scenario, machines reach AGI and some form of sentience. They become as smart and capable as humans. Yet there is no particular reason that human intelligence should be the upper limit. So these AI, in turn, help design smarter AIs still. Superintelligence emerges. In the fourth scenario, human supremacy ends. 
* Rather than being worried about one giant AI apocalypse, we need to worry about the many small catastrophes that AI can bring.
