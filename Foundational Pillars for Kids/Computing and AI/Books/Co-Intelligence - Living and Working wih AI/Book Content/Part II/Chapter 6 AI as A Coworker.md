### Notes

* Most jobs, particularly the non-physical ones will be affected by AI
* But *jobs* are made of *tasks*, although AI might be able to do some of the tasks for us, it's still the human's job to *manage* and *curate* and AI's output
* We all work within *systems*, there are many *customers* and *stakeholders* within the systems that might prevent replacing humans with AI. 

#### Tasks and the Jagged Frontier

* There is a danger that we trust AI's work too much
* When AI is good, humans rely more on AI and as a result, they do less critical thinking on their own. This hurts human learning, skill development and productivity
* This requires us understanding what tasks should be done by AI and what are better left for us to tackle.

#### Tasks for Me, Tasks for AI

* It's hard to find task that no AI can do. But that does not mean we want AI to do everything, this could be due to personal or ethical reasons. For example, we might still want human to raise kids, make important decisions, or expressing our values. These are the *Just Me Tasks*. 
* For example, writing a very personal process and it can be a journey our self-discovery, you wouldn't want to delegate that to an Al no matter how much better it can write.
* The *Just Me Task* are going to change as AI evolves. The most important thing is that you should always reserves the *meaningful* and *fulfilling* task as a human being for yourself. 
* There are *Delegated Tasks* that you want the AI to do for you (of course, you still need to *check* to make sure there is no hallucinations). There are often boring, repetitive and tedious tasks. But these task are not necessarily simple, they can be complex too. Such as filling your tax form, giving investment advice or diagnosing your health problem. 
* There are *Automated Tasks* that you can just trust AI to complete on its own without your intervention at all.

#### Centaurs and Cyborgs

* *Centaurs*: There is a clear line between the work done by human and AI. 
* *Cyborgs*: The work AI and human do are closely integrated

#### Secret Task Automation

* People using AI to boost their productivity often tend to hide this from their employer due to the fear of being laid off
* To stay competitive, companies should encourage employees to bring forward their attempt at trying to us AI to increase productivity.

#### From Tasks to Systems

* Different systems we use to structure and coordinate work in our organizations are shaped by the technological and social conditions of their times, such as organizational chart, the assembly line, the internet. 
* But these systems still reply on human *capabilities* and *limitations*. The technology changes, but workers and mangers are still just people. 
* In Pre-LLM AI, companies use *algorithms* to control work and workers. This is called *Algorithmic Management*. An example is Uber. Such systems has all the information about all workers and their status in real time. They control where drivers go, how much they make and how they spend their time. 
* With LLM, a system is created where every aspect of work is monitored and controlled by AI. But this is unlike the algorithm approach, since AI can be more personal and friendly.
* AI can be and should be used to automate the boring, repetitive and tedious work in an organization. This can free human to work on more creative and engaging work that would eventually improve the whole working experience.

#### From Systems to Jobs

* Some tasks in jobs are likely to be automated by AI, especially those boring and repetitive tasks. But when it comes to systems, AI replacing human workers are going to be at a slower pace. Humans are built deep into the fabric of every aspect of our organizations. They cannot be easily replaced by AI without tearing the fabric. *Systems are more resistant to change than tasks*. 
* But there are industries that are completely demolished by AI, such as stock photography and call center. At the same time, new industries are springing up, like those servicing and deploying AI systems. And a lot of existing industries will be supercharged. 
* New technologies did replace human workers in the history, such as phone-operators. But the job market overall adjusted quickly, a lot of operators found new jobs with better pay. But this AI wave is different because 1) it broadly affects the highest paid workers; 2) it's adoption is much quicker, and much broader. 
* Since those with low initial capability benefit the most from AI, this suggests using AI as a great leveler to turn everyone into excellent worker. 

### Summary

Jobs are made of different tasks. Humans should take good advantage of AI  to automate those boring, repetitive and tedious tasks. But for tasks that are personal, fulfilling or meaningful, they should still be reserve for humans. So we need to clearly distinguish between *Just for Me* task and *Delegated Tasks*. Over reliance on AI can result in less critical thinking in humans, and hurt our learning, skill development and productivity. 

When it comes to Systems, AI can control and monitor every aspect of the work in an organization. But we still need humans, augmented with task-focused AI to complete the work. And it is going to be difficult to completely replace human in a system due to the vast implication this can entail. Just imagining replacing doctors in a hospital, how would the patient feel? how does reliability work? how would other worker in the hospital react?
