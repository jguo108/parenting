### Notes

* What does this technology mean for the future of work and education?
* An alien co-intelligence, one that can interact well with humans, without being human or, indeed, sentient.
* *General Purpose Technologies* typically have slow adoption, as they require many other technologies to work well. The internet is a great example.
* So I want to try to take you on a tour of AI as a new thing in the world, a co-intelligence, with all the ambiguity that the term implies.
