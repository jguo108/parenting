Yes, the author identifies several potential critiques and opposing views throughout the book and addresses them in various ways, using evidence and logic. Here are some examples:

- **Critique of early memory research:** In the context of distributed learning, the author mentions C. E. Buxton's influential review of research up to 1943, where Buxton concluded that Ballard's "spontaneous improvement effect" was a "phantom". The author uses this as an "object lesson in how to interpret research", highlighting the importance of testing, replication, and building upon previous experimental evidence in science. This implicitly addresses the critique by showing how scientific understanding evolves through scrutiny and further investigation.
    
- **Opposition to the increased use of standardized testing:** The author acknowledges the debate surrounding standardized testing in education, noting that many teachers complain about "teaching to the test" and that such tests are seen as incomplete measures of learning. Robert Bjork is quoted saying that due to negative connotations, teachers often resist the idea of more testing. To address this resistance, the author mentions that researchers have begun to call testing by other names to soften the resistance. Furthermore, the book explores the benefits of testing as a learning tool itself, separate from its use as an evaluative measure.
    
- **The "Math Wars" debate:** The author details the historical "math wars," which involved opposing views on how mathematics should be taught. One side, the "progressives," favoured abstract skills and independent thinking, while the "conservatives" valued drills and rote practice. The author presents this as a debate where neither side had definitive research to win the argument at the time. The author then introduces the work of John Saxon and Doug Rohrer, who advocated for "mixed review" or "interleaving" – mixing problems from different topics – as a more effective approach than teaching in blocks. By presenting the positive results of interleaving in improving math comprehension, the author offers a research-backed perspective that potentially bridges the gap between the opposing views of the math wars, suggesting a more nuanced approach to mathematical learning.
    
- **Concerns about distractions from technology:** The author addresses the common concern that social media and smartphones interfere with learning. The author refutes the idea that distraction is always bad, stating that short study breaks involving these technologies can be the "most effective technique learning scientists know of to help you solve a problem when you're stuck". The logic here is that distraction allows one to let go of mistaken assumptions and re-examine clues with a fresh perspective, with the brain continuing to work subconsciously on the problem during the break.
    
- **Traditional views on concentration:** The author challenges the traditional notion of concentration as a continuous, unbroken focus. By recounting an anecdote of his own seemingly distracted work habits being recorded in detail by a colleague, the author suggests that concentration might include breaks, diversions, and random thoughts. This challenges the conventional view of what effective work and learning look like.
    

In these examples, the author addresses critiques and opposing views by presenting historical context, research findings, logical arguments, and alternative perspectives supported by evidence from the field of learning science. The author does not necessarily aim to definitively "win" these arguments but rather to offer a more nuanced and evidence-based understanding of learning processes.
