The book *How We Learn* by Benedict Carey employs a **combination of argument structures**, with the most prominent being:

### 1. **Problem-Solution**  
• **Structure**: The book identifies a core problem—traditional learning methods are inefficient and counterproductive (e.g., cramming, rigid study habits)—and offers science-backed solutions (e.g., spaced repetition, strategic distraction, sleep consolidation).  
• **Example**: Carey critiques the "grind" mentality (problem) and replaces it with evidence-based techniques like varied study environments and interleaving (solution).

### 2. **Thematic**  
• **Structure**: The book is organized into thematic sections (Basic Theory, Retention, Problem Solving, Tapping the Subconscious), each exploring distinct dimensions of learning. These themes collectively support the central argument that learning thrives when aligned with the brain’s natural processes.  
• **Example**: Chapters on memory biology, forgetting, and sleep each tackle a specific theme tied to optimizing learning.

### 3. **Narrative/Story-Driven**  
• **Structure**: Carey uses personal anecdotes (e.g., his college struggles, experiments with learning techniques) and relatable stories to humanize scientific concepts.  
• **Example**: The introduction recounts his journey from a stressed student to a science journalist, framing the book as a discovery of learning’s "surprising truths."

### 4. **Analytical**  
• **Structure**: The book deconstructs learning into components (e.g., memory formation, forgetting, subconscious processing) and examines their roles through cognitive science research.  
• **Example**: Carey analyzes how forgetting aids memory consolidation or why distractions can enhance problem-solving.

### Why Not Other Structures?  
• **Chronological**: While the book references studies and historical scientific progress, it does not follow a strict timeline.  
• **Compare and Contrast**/**Pro-Con**: Though Carey contrasts ineffective vs. effective strategies, this is secondary to the problem-solution framework.  
• **List-Based**: While techniques are presented as actionable takeaways, they are integrated into thematic chapters rather than formatted as explicit lists.

### Dominant Structure: **Problem-Solution + Thematic**  
The book’s core framework is **problem-solution**, structured around **thematic exploration** of learning science. The narrative and analytical elements serve to illustrate and validate its claims. This hybrid approach allows Carey to address both the *why* (the problem) and the *how* (thematic solutions) of effective learning.
