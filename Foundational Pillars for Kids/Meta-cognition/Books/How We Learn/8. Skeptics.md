Here are five potentially weaker claims made in the book, along with counterarguments drawn from within the text and suggestions for better evidence within the context of the author's discussion:

- **Claim 1:** "Taking a test on a subject before you know anything about it improves subsequent learning".
    
    - **Original Text:** "Taking a test on a subject before you know anything about it improves subsequent learning."
        
    - **Counterarguments from Peer-Reviewed Studies (within the source):** While the author presents this as a finding that "nagged" at him and was "worth trying", the subsequent discussion of Bjork and Soderstrom's pretesting experiment in Chapter 5 provides a more nuanced picture. Their study showed that students who took a pretest on lecture topics performed about **10 percent higher** on related questions in a final exam compared to unrelated ones. However, they also note that the students **"tanked each pretest"**. The benefit seems to be in priming the students for the vocabulary and concepts, and this benefit is explicitly tied to getting prompt feedback (as in their African capitals test). The initial claim in Chapter 1 lacks this crucial condition of feedback.
        
    - **Suggest Better Evidence the Author Could Have Used:** Instead of stating it as a general principle in the introduction, the author could have introduced this idea alongside the discussion of the Bjork and Soderstrom study in Chapter 5. This would have allowed for a more accurate presentation of the findings, highlighting the importance of **related questions and subsequent exposure to the correct information** (either through lectures or feedback) for the pretesting effect to be beneficial. The author could have also contrasted this with situations where pretesting without feedback might not yield the same positive results, if such discussions were present in the research they encountered.
        
- **Claim 2:** The effectiveness of the "Study Aid" brain chemistry theory ("you want the same brain chemistry" during studying and testing) is rooted in something deeper than wishful thinking.
    
    - **Original Text:** "Still, millions of students have developed some version of the brain chemistry idea, and I think its enduring attraction is rooted in something deeper than wishful thinking."
        
    - **Counterarguments from Peer-Reviewed Studies (within the source):** The author follows this statement by referencing a study where students who smoked marijuana performed similarly on a word recall test whether they were high or sober during study and test, suggesting that state-dependent memory exists. However, the author immediately qualifies this by stating, "This finding suggests that the brain stores roughly the same number of words when moderately high as when not—the words are in there, either way. Yet it must organise them in a different way for later retrieval. That 'retrieval key' comes back most clearly when the brain is in the same state, stoned or sober. The key becomes superfluous, however, when the categories are printed right there on the page. There’s no need for it, because an external one is handy". Furthermore, the author notes that giving someone a real hint (an external cue) easily trumps these internal, drug-induced memory cues. This significantly weakens the idea that the "brain chemistry" theory has a deep, reliable basis beyond the specific and limited context of state-dependent memory, especially when strong external cues are present.
        
    - **Suggest Better Evidence the Author Could Have Used:** To strengthen this claim, the author would need to present evidence showing the "enduring attraction" is based on actual improved learning outcomes due to mimicking brain chemistry, _beyond_ the narrow scope of state-dependent recall and in situations where external cues are not readily available. The current evidence presented suggests that while internal states can act as retrieval cues, their impact is often weak compared to external hints. The author could have explored if research shows students genuinely perform better on exams by maintaining the same "study aid" brain chemistry, controlling for other factors like ritual and placebo effects. Without such evidence, the claim relies more on the persistence of a belief than robust scientific support within the provided text.
        
- **Claim 3:** Distractions can aid learning. (Presented as a general principle in the introduction).
    
    - **Original Text:** "Distractions can aid learning. Napping does, too."
        
    - **Counterarguments from Peer-Reviewed Studies (within the source):** While Chapter 6 extensively discusses the "Upside of Distraction" in the context of breaking fixation in problem-solving, the initial statement in the introduction lacks this crucial context. The author later clarifies that distraction is a hazard if continuous focus is needed, like during a lecture. The benefit of distraction appears to be specific to situations where one is stuck on a problem and needs to break free from unproductive thinking. The blanket statement in the introduction could be misleading.
        
    - **Suggest Better Evidence the Author Could Have Used:** The author should have introduced the idea of distractions aiding learning within the specific context of problem-solving and incubation, which is the main focus of Chapter 6. Qualifying the statement early on by acknowledging that distractions are detrimental to tasks requiring continuous attention would have provided a more accurate and less potentially confusing introduction to this concept. The evidence from studies on the Remote Associates Test (RAT) and the meta-analysis by Sio and Ormerod would have been more relevant to cite early on if the intention was to immediately support this claim.
        
- **Claim 4:** Quitting before a project is done is not all bad, as an almost done project lingers in memory far longer than one that is completed. (Referring to the Zeigarnik effect as a universally positive phenomenon).
    
    - **Original Text:** "Quitting before a project is done: not all bad, as an almost done project lingers in memory far longer than one that is completed."
        
    - **Counterarguments from Peer-Reviewed Studies (within the source):** While the author introduces the Zeigarnik effect positively, the discussion in Chapter 7, referencing Zeigarnik's original work, focuses on the enhanced memory for interrupted tasks. The book doesn't delve into potential downsides of frequently leaving tasks unfinished, such as increased stress, decreased feelings of accomplishment, or potential difficulties in recalling details if the interruption is too long or if there are too many unfinished projects. A. V. Zeigarnik's memoir might provide a more nuanced perspective on her mother's work, but the excerpts here don't elaborate on potential negative consequences.
        
    - **Suggest Better Evidence the Author Could Have Used:** A more balanced approach would involve discussing the optimal conditions and potential drawbacks of leveraging the Zeigarnik effect. Are there studies that explore the impact of _too many_ unfinished tasks on memory or motivation? Does the "lingering in memory" always translate to better completion rates or deeper learning in the long run? Exploring these nuances, if present in the literature the author drew from, would have strengthened the discussion beyond a seemingly universally beneficial effect of quitting early.
        
- **Claim 5:** The "Night Shift Theory" provides some basis on which to experiment on our own, to adjust our sleep to our advantage where possible. (As a definitive guide for optimizing sleep for learning).
    
    - **Original Text:** "At least with the Night Shift Theory, we have some basis on which to experiment on our own, to adjust our sleep to our advantage where possible."
        
    - **Counterarguments from Peer-Reviewed Studies (within the source):** While the author presents the "Night Shift Theory" (the idea that different sleep stages are specialized for consolidating different types of skills) as a "remarkable hypothesis" with supporting evidence, they also acknowledge that the effects of sleep schedules on learning are "likely to be highly individual". The theory is still presented as a hypothesis under investigation. Suggesting it as a firm "basis on which to experiment" for everyone might overstate the current level of scientific certainty and fail to account for the complexity of individual sleep needs and learning styles.
        
    - **Suggest Better Evidence the Author Could Have Used:** Instead of presenting it as a definite basis for experimentation, the author could have framed it more cautiously, as a promising area of research that _suggests_ a potential link between sleep stages and learning. Emphasising the "highly individual" nature of sleep needs and the ongoing research in this area would have provided a more accurate reflection of the science. The author could have also mentioned potential risks or limitations of drastically altering sleep schedules without professional guidance, if such considerations were relevant to the research they reviewed.
