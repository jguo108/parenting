# Chapter 15 - Ceremony of Welcome and Blessing

### Principle

*If a son does not receive blessing from his father, he will spend the rest of his life trying to earn that blessing. Creating a blessing ceremony will help cement our sonsâ€™ identity and heal wounds they have suffered along the way. It is something only we as fathers can give to our sons.*
